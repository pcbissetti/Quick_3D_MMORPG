Absolutely 100% unsupported, and full of infuriating bugs.

If you are like me, it's nice to dig around and follow along when source code is provided. There were a couple hurdles getting running on this one so I figured I'd share.

Server side

npm start


Client side
Run a simple http-server to serve up the files. If you don't do this you will get CORS issues.

$ http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./

Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
I was able to see the login screen, walk around and kill some monsters named after my username lol.
